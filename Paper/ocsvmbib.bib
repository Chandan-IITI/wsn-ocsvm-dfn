  Abstract                 = {This paper shows the use of a data domain description method, inspired by the support vector machine by Vapnik, called the support vector domain description (SVDD). This data description can be used for novelty or outlier detection. A spherically shaped decision boundary around a set of objects is constructed by a set of support vectors describing the sphere boundary. It has the possibility of transforming the data to new feature spaces without much extra computational cost. By using the transformed data, this SVDD can obtain more flexible and more accurate data descriptions. The error of the first kind, the fraction of the training objects which will be rejected, can be estimated immediately from the description without the use of an independent test set, which makes this method data efficient. The support vector domain description is compared with other outlier detection methods on real data.},

abstract = {As one of the methods to solve one-class classification problems (OCC), one-class support vector machines (OCSVM) have been applied to fault detection in recent years. Among all the kernels available for OCSVM, the Gaussian kernel is the most commonly used one. The selection of Gaussian kernel parameters influences greatly the performances of classifiers, which remains as an open problem. In this paper two methods are proposed to select Gaussian kernel parameters in OCSVM: according to the first one, the parameters are selected using the information of the farthest and the nearest neighbors of each sample; using the second one, the parameters are determined via detecting the "tightness" of the decision boundaries. The two proposed methods are tested on UCI data sets and Tennessee Eastman Process benchmark data sets. The results show that, the two proposed methods can be used to select suitable parameters for the Gaussian kernel, enabling the resulting OCSVM models to perform well on fault detection. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.
